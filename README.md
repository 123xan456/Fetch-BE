# README

## Overview
This project consists of a simple server and client application. The server exposes API endpoints, and the client interacts with the server. 
The instructions below guide you through the setup and execution of the project.

This service requires Python 3.8 and above, and pip

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional)

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Run server
```bash
python3 server.py
```
This runs the server and exposes the APIs

### 5. Run client (optional)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

This runs the client if you want to use it. Otherwise, you can interact with the API with any program of your choice.
